### Prices

The best measure for summarizing the price of electronics is the **median**, 425.

The mean is a poor choice, because the extreme prices of 4 and 2932 skew the average. The mode is also insufficient, as all prices occur exactly once.

### Bootcamp Ages

The best measures for summarizing the ages of Bootcamp students are the **mean**, 36, and the **median**, also 36.

The mean is a good choice, because the lowest and highest ages are not substantially higher or lower than the average. The median is also a good choice, as it returns the same result, and would not change if there _were_ extreme ages in the data set.

### Children's Party Ages

The best measure for summarizing the ages of children and chaperones at a birthday party is the **mode**.

The mean, 19, is a poor choice, because it characterizes the average attendee as a teenager, when no one at the party is older than 6 or younger than 35.

The median, 6, works well in this case. _But_, it is fragile: If we had just one more 34 year old parent, the median would be 34, _not_ 6.

### Geography Test Scores

The best measure for summarizing this test score data is the **mean**, since the lowest and highest scores are close to the average. The median is also a good choice.

The mode is not particularly informative, because all test scores occur exactly once.

### Quantum Mechanics Test Scores

Finally, the best measures for summarizing this test score data are the **median** and the **mode**.

The median, 58, gives a fairly good description of how the test went for the class. Some students scored very low (scores of 8 and 13); one scored very high (98); and the rest were somewhere in the middle, which the median detects.

In this case, the mean, 45, would reveal similar information — that the class mostly did poorly — but does not give the best picture as to what scores students actually ended up with.
