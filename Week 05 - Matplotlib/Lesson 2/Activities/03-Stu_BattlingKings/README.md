# Plotting Pandas Data

## Instructions

Your task is to plot the _total_ number of battles each king in the Game of Thrones data set participated in. In other words, you need to determine how many times each king started a battle, _and_ how many times they were defenders.

* Use Pandas to load the `got.csv` data set.

* Create a Series containing the number of times each king was an attacker.

* Create a Series containing the number of times each king was a defender.

* Combine these two variables into a single Series. _Hint_: How should you combine these two Series? Can you add Series in Pandas?

* Use your combined data to retrieve labels for your x-ticks.

* Create a red bar chart, and set its x-tick labels appropriately.

* Add a title and labels to your plot.

* Display your plot. Who participated in the most battles? The least?
