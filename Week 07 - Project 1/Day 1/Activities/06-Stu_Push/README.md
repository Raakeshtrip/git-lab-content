# Remotes & Push

This activity gives students experience with adding remotes and using `git push`.

## Instructions

* Create a new GitHub repo to associate with the local Git repo you've been working on thus far. Add it as the `origin` remote.

* Next, checkout your `master` branch, and push it to GitHub.

* Create a new branch, and change something in your project (edit one of your existing files, add a new one, etc). Add and commit this change, and push your new branch to GitHub.

* Checkout `master`, and merge it with the branch you just created.

* Push the updated `master` branch to GitHub.

## Bonuses

* Use the `-u` flag the first time you use `git push` to set default upstream branches for `master` and the branch you create.
