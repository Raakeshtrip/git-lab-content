# Git Pull

This demonstration allows students to practice pushing to and pulling from branches on GitHub in accordance with best practices for collaboration.

## Instructions

* For the sake of this activity, elect a team leader. This leader will **create** and **push** changes to a repository that other members will **pull** from.

* **Before starting**:

  * The team leader should create a new GitHub repo.

  * Each member of the team should `clone` this repo to their computer..

* On the `master` branch of the project, the team _leader_ should add and commit a file, called `data_exploration.py`, and then push their changes to GitHub.

  * Team members should then pull these changes to their local machines.

* After pulling, each team member should **create a new branch**, whose name should follow the formula: `<name>/branching_exercise`, where `<name>` is a placeholder for your name.

  * Next, each team member should add and commit a file named: `<name>.txt`. Add a message to the file so it can be committed.

  * After saving the file, each team member should push their respective branches to GitHub.

* Next, each team member should checkout the `master` branch.

* While on `master`, everyone should should pull changes from GitHub.

* After pulling from GitHub, explore what's new: Look at what teammates have added, etc.

* Try checking out a team member's branch: `git checkout <team_member_name>`.
