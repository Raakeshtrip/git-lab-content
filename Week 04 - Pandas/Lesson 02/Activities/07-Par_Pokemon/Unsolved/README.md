# Creating a Pokedex

In this activity, you will gain experience massaging DataFrames and creating tables.

## Instructions

1. Read the Pokemon CSV file with Pandas.

2. Create a new table by extracting the following columns: Type 1, HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed.

3. Find the average stats for each `type` of Pokemon.

4. Create a new DataFrame out of the averages.

5. Calculate the _total_ average stats for each Pokemon type and set it to a new column named `Total`.

6. Sort the table by strongest type.

7. Export the resulting table to Excel.
