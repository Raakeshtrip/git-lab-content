## Cryptocurrency Merging

### Instructions

* Read in both of the CSV files and print out their DataFrames.

* Perform an inner merge that combines both DataFrames on the "Date" column.

* Rename the columns within the newly merged DataFrame so that the headers are more descriptive.

* Create a summary table that includes the following information: `Best Bitcoin Open`, `Best Dash Open`, `Best Bitcoin Close`, `Best Dash Close`, `Total Bitcoin Volume`, `Total Dash Volume`.

* `Total Bitcoin Volume` and `Total Dash Volume` should be calculated to have units of "millions" and be rounded to two decimal places.
