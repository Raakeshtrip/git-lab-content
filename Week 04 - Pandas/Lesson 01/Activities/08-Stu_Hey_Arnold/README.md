# Hey, Arnold!

* This assignment will give you experience creating DataFrames from scratch.

* You will create a pandas DataFrame of characters from this TV show: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold!>

## Instructions

* First, use Pandas to create a DataFrame with the following columns and values:

  * `Character_in_show`: Arnold, Gerald, Helga, Phoebe, Harold, Eugene

  * `color_of_hair`: blonde, black, blonde, black, unknown, red

  * `Height`: average, tallish, tallish, short, tall, short

  * `Football_Shaped_Head`: True, False, False, False, False, False

* You'll note that the above column names are inconsistent and difficult to work with. Rename them to the following, respectively:

  * `Character`, `Hair Color`, `Height`, `Football Head`

* Next, create a new table that contains all of the columns in the following order...

  * `Character`, `Football Head`, `Hair Color`, `Height`
