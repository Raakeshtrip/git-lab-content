## Instructions

* In this activity, we return again to the PySchools homework assignment, this time in R.

### Part I

* Create a Tibble: it will be a summary of statistics for each school:

### Part II

* If time allows, create a Tibble that is a district-wide summary of schools:

* Most of the calculations have already been performed for you in the Rmd file. Your task is to assemble a new Tibble with this information.
