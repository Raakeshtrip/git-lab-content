* Remember PySchools from your pandas homework assignment? We are going back to school!

* Use `students.csv` to identify the following information about the data set, only using R this time:

  * A list of all schools
  * Calculate the total count of schools
  * Calculate the total number of students
  * Calculate the average reading and math scores
  * Calculate the percentage of students with passing reading scores, i.e. over 70%.
  * Calculate the percentage of students with passing math scores, i.e. over 70%.
  * Calculate the overall passing rate, i.e. the average of math and reading passing percentages

* Feel free to explore further and answer additional questions from the homework assignment. The Jupyter Notebook file is included in this exercise for your convenience.
