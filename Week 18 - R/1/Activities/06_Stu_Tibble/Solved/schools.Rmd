```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Dependency
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
### Read CSV file
```{r}
students <-read_csv("students.csv")
```
### Preview tibble
```{r}
head(students)
```

### A list of all schools
```{r}
# unique(dataset, variable) displays unique elements from that column
unique(students$school_name)
```

### Calculate the total count of schools
```{r}
school_count <- unique(students$school_name)
# Use length() to identify the number of schools
length(school_count)
paste("There are", length(school_count), "schools")
```

### Calculate the total number of students
```{r}
# nrow() returns the number of rows
student_count <-  nrow(students)
paste("There are a total of", student_count, "students.")
```

### Calculate the average reading and math scores
```{r}
mean_reading_score <- summarize(students, mean(reading_score))
paste("The average reading score is", mean_reading_score)

mean_math_score <- summarize(students, mean(math_score))
paste("The average math score is", mean_math_score)
```
### Calculate the percentage of students with passing reading scores, i.e. over 70%.
```{r}
passing_reading <- filter(students, reading_score > 70)
passing_reading_count <- nrow(passing_reading)
percentage_passing_reading <- passing_reading_count*100 / student_count
percentage_passing_reading <- round(percentage_passing_reading,2)

paste(percentage_passing_reading, "% of the students have passing reading scores.")
```
### Calculate the percentage of students with passing math scores, i.e. over 70%.
```{r}
passing_math <- filter(students, math_score > 70)
passing_math_count <- nrow(passing_math)
percentage_passing_math <- passing_math_count*100 / student_count
percentage_passing_math <- round(percentage_passing_math, 2)

paste(percentage_passing_math, "% of the students have passing math scores.")
```
### Calculate the overall passing rate, i.e. the average of math and reading passing percentages
```{r}
overall_passing_rate <- (percentage_passing_math + percentage_passing_reading) / 2
overall_passing_rate
```
### Calculate the average math and reading scores by school
```{r}
school_grouping <- group_by(students, school_name)
summarize(school_grouping, avg.reading=mean(reading_score), avg.math = mean(math_score))
```

### Calculate the average math and reading scores by grade level at each school
```{r}
grade_grouping <- group_by(students, school_name, grade)
summarize(grade_grouping, avg.reading=mean(reading_score), avg.math=mean(math_score))
```
