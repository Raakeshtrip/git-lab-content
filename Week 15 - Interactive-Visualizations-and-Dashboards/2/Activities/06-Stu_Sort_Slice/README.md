# Slice, Dice, and Sort

## Instructions

### Part 1: Practice

Spend a few minutes sharpening your skills in sorting, slicing, and reversing.

* Sort the given arrays in ascending and descending order.

* Use an arrow function to sort an array.

* Slice and reverse an array.

### Part 2: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

* Create a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 Greek gods by their popularity, as reflected by the number of searches in `data.js`.

* Sort the data array of objects by `greekSearchResults`.

* Slice the top 10 objects from the array.

* Create a horizontal bar chart that plots the top 10 Greek gods in descending order, based on the search results.

## Hints

* You will have to consult Plotly's [documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/horizontal-bar-charts/) on creating a horizontal bar chart.

* Here are further resources you may wish to consult:

  * [Stack Overflow sorting objects](https://stackoverflow.com/a/979289)

  * [MDN docs on the sort function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)

* After sorting, slice the first 10 objects for your plots. Go to the [MDN docs on the slice function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) for help with this step.
