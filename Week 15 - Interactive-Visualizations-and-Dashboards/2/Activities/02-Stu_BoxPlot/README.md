# Box Plots

* In this activity, you will create box plots for temperatures in New York and in Houston.

* In the separate bonus activity, you will create box plots of the survival rates of cancer patients.

## Instructions

* Inspect the data in `data.js`. It contains daily mean temperature readings in New York and Houston from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015.

* Create a box plot of both cities.

* Interpret the results. What information and trends can you gather from the boxplots?

* The data in this activity is taken from [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).

## Bonus Activity (Challenging)

* See the Bonus folder for the activity files.

* The data set for the bonus activity contains data from a cancer study, in which patients were treated with ascorbate. The purpose of this study was to determine whether different organs have different survival times.

**Note:** This study found that the square root transformation appears to make the residuals more symmetric, so use the square root of survival as the dependent variable.

* Create a box plot for each organ type.

* Calculate the square root of the survival as the depended variable. Use `map` to apply the square root.
