# The Thrill of the Case

In this activity, you will practice using switch statements in JavaScript to direct control flow.

## Instructions

If you feel you need more practice with switch statements, work through option A before attempting option B. If you feel comfortable with switch statements, feel free to jump right into option B.

### Option A

* Create a function, using a switch statement, that takes an uppercase letter as an argument and prints to the console the corresponding numbers for the following letters:

  * A: 1

  * B: 2

  * C: 3

  * D: 4

  * E: 5

* If the argument is not one of the letters above, the switch statement should print a zero.

### Option B

* Create a dynamic line chart with a dropdown menu in Plotly.

  * It should use a switch statement to select from the three datasets.

  * The chart should display the first dataset after the page loads.

  * The switch statement should include a fourth dummy dataset as its default option.

* Your datasets are the following:

  ```js
  // Default dataset:
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Dataset 1:
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  y = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5];

  // Dataset 2:
  x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
  y = [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000];

  // Dataset 3:
  x = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];
  y = [10, 100, 50, 10, 0];
  ```
