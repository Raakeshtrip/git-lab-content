# A Flicker of the Eye

## Instructions

In this activity, you will create your first Plotly bar chart to show the relationship between eye color and frequency of eye flickers, using the information in `eye_flicker.csv`.

* In the script file, create an array called `eyeColor` that replicates the `Color` column in the CSV file: `var eyeColor = ["Brown", "Brown", etc.]`.

* Do the same for the `Flicker` column: `var eyeFlicker = [26.8, 27.9, etc]`.

* Use Plotly to create a bar chart of eye color versus the frequency of eye flickers.

* What happens? What is Plotly doing?
