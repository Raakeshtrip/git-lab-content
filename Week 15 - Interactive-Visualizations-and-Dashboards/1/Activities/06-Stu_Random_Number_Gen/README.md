# Random Number Generator

## Instructions

In this activity, you will create an array of 5 PowerballÂ® lottery numbers between 1 and 59 using JavaScript's `Math` library. Here are the steps you may want to consider to accomplish this task: 

  * Create an array.

  * Use `Math.random()` to generate numbers between 1 and 59.

  * Round these numbers (either up or down).

  * Push each randomly generated number to an array.

## Bonus

In the Powerball lottery, there is a multiplier number drawn between 1 and 35. In addition to creating 5 random Powerball numbers above, add a 6th number between 1 and 35.
