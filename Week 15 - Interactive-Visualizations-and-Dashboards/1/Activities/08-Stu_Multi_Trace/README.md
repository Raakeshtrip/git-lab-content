# Greek vs. Roman Mythology

In this activity, you will compare search results between Greek mythology and Roman mythology to see which god is most popular.

## Instructions

Ancient Roman gods were often counterparts to or imports of Greek gods. For example, the Greek god Zeus became the Roman god Jupiter via an etymological transformation from Zeus to Zeus Pater ("Father Zeus") to Jupiter. (Classical Latin lacked a "J" consonant.) The question is, in today's world, are these gods better known by their Roman names or Greek names?

Your task is to plot the number of search results, of both Roman and Greek names, returned for each god in order to answer this question. Begin by examining the data in `data.js`.

* To accomplish this task, you will need to create two traces, one for Roman gods, and another for Greek gods.

* To define the data for each plot point in a trace, use the `map()` method on the dataset. For each trace:

  * For the x-axis, use `map()` to return an array of the paired string of Greek and Roman names, e.g., Amphitrite-Salacia.

  * For the y-axis, use `map()` to return an array of search results.

* Examine `data.js` to determine how you will do this.
