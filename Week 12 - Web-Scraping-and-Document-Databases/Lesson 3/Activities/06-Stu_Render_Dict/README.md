# Smart Pet Adoption

## Instructions

* Create a list of dictionaries with keys of animal `name` and `type`. For example: `{"name": "Fido", "type": "Lab"}`

* Loop through the list and display an unordered list in `index.html`.

* Each list item should include the name of the animal and its type.

* Finally add some CSS styling to each list item.
