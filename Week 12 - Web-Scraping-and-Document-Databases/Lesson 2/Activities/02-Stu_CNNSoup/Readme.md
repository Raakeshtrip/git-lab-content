# A Soup Starter

## Instructions

* Believe it or not, CNN's website for **1996: Year in Review** is still alive on the web: <http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/>

* We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

* Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

1. The **title**

2. All **paragraph** texts

3. The top 10 headlines (warning: this one is a bit tricky, and may not come out perfectly!)

## Hints

* For the third task, you will need a means of filtering the data, perhaps over multiple iterations.

## Bonus

* If you finish early, head over to the [Beautful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read up on accessing `attributes` and navigating the DOM.
