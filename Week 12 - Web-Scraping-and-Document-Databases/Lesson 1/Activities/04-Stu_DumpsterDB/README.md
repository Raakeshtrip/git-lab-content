# Dumpster DB

## Instructions

* Create and use a new database called `Dumpster_DB` using the Mongo shell.

* Create a collection called `divers` which will contain a string field for `name`, an integer field for `yearsDiving`, a boolean field for `stillDiving`, and an array of strings for `bestFinds`.

* Insert three new documents into the collection. Be creative with what you put in here and have some fun with it.

* Update the `yearsDiving` fields for your documents so that they are one greater than their original values.

* Update the `stillDiving` value for one of the documents so that it is now false.

* Push a new value into the `bestFinds` array for one of the documents.

* Look through the collection, find the diver with the smallest number of `bestFinds`, and remove it from the collection.
