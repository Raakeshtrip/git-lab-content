# Mongo Class

## Instructions

* Use the command line to create a `ClassDB` database

* Insert entries into this database for yourself and the people around you within a collection called `students`

* Each document should have a field of `name` with the person's name, a field of `favoriteLibrary` for the person's favorite Python library, a field of `age` for the person's age, and a field of `hobbies` which will hold a list of that person's hobbies.

* Use the `find()` commands to get a list of everyone of a specific age before using `name` to collect the entry for a single person.
