# Word Counter

## Instructions

* Create a function in JavaScript that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a string. 

* The function should take in a string as its parameter.

* Use an object to hold word frequency in key-value pairs. For example, the following will be the frequency list for the string **"I yam what I yam and always will be what I yam"**

  ```js
  {
    I: 3,
    always: 1,
    am: 1,
    and: 1,
    be: 1,
    what: 2,
    will: 1,
    yam: 3
  }
  ```
  
* Call the function with a test string.  

## Hints

* How would you split a string into an array of words?

* Start the word frequency counter an empty object.

* How would you determine whether a word already exists in the object?
