# Recipes Objects

In this activity, you will practice iterating over arrays of objects.

## Instructions

* Create two empty arrays called `dishes` and `spices`.

* Use `Object.entries` and `forEach()` to iterate over an array of recipe objects.

* Push each dish into the `dishes` array.

* Push each spice into the `spices` array.

* Log each final array to the console.

## Bonus

* Create both arrays using `map` instead of `forEach`.
