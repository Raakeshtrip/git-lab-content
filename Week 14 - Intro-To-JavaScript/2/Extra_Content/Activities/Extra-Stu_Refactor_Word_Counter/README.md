# Word Counter Refactored

## Instructions

* Refactor (update/rewrite) the word counter function that you wrote earlier, this time using ES6 features.

* Declare your word counter function as an arrow function.

* Instead of a for-loop, use the `forEach` method to loop through your array of words.
