## HINTS

* Start at the top of the tree and write the `if, else if, else` statement for income level. Then, fill in each of those with the `if, else` statements needed for the final decisions.

* Consider writing the code in Python first and then translate it to JavaScript.

* If time allows, begin looking into how a ternary operator works in JavaScript: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).
