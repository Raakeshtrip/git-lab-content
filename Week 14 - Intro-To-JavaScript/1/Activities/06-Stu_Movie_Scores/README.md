# Movie Score Looping

## Instructions

* Given a list of movie scores, determine how many good, ok and bad movies were there.

* Create a for loop to go through the `movieScore` list.

* Add scores over 7 to the `goodMovies` array.

* Add scores between 5 and 7 to the `okMovies` array.

* Add the rest of the scores to the the `badMovies` array.

* Also, calculate the average rating for all of the movies.

* Finally, print out how many good, ok and bad movies there were and what the overall total score was.

## Hints

* You will need to research how to push elements to an empty array.

* Check the [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_length_array.asp) to find the length of the array.
