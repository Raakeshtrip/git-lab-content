# Manipulating CSV Files

In this activity, you will use list comprehensions to compose a wedding invitation to send to every name on your mailing list.

## Instructions

* Open the file called `comprehensions.py`.

* Run the provided program. Note that nothing forces you to write the name "properly"â€”e.g., as "Jane" instead of "jAnE". You will use list comprehensions to fix this.

  * First, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the lowercase version of each of the names your user provided.

  * Then, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the title-cased versions of each of the names in your lower-cased list.

## Bonuses

* Instead of creating a lower-cased list and _then_ a title-cased list, create the title-cased list in a single comprehension.

## Hints

* See the documentation for the [title](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title) method.
