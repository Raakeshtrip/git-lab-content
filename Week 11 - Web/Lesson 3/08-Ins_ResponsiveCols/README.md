# Responsive Cols

* The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate how we can use different sized Bootstrap column classes on the same element to control how it should appear at various screen sizes.

## Instructions

* Open the [`index.html`](Solved/index.html) file in both your editor and in your browser.

* Notice how when you shrink the browser window, the columns resize twice at small and extra small screen sizes.

* Notice how multiple column classes are applied to each column inside of `index.html`. Each class's styles take over at the appropriate screen sizes.
