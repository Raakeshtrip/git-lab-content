# Media Queries

* In this activity we will continue working with the solution to the review activity from earlier today. We will add media queries to make the web page more responsive at smaller screen sizes.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved Folder](Unsolved) and add media queries to decrease the size of the `li` tags inside the `navbar` so they fit when we shrink the screen size. We can probably do this by reducing each `li` element's `padding`.

* Also reduce the `padding` along each side of the `article` with a class of `post`.

## Bonus

* Try making the `li` elements inside the `navbar` disappear entirely in place of a drop-down menu with all of the same options.

## Hints

* A reference for media query syntax can be found at [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

* You can create a drop-down menu using the `select` and `option` elements. See [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) for `select` elements.

* You can show and hide elements on a web page with the visibility property. See [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility)
