# Chrome Devtools

* In this activity we will use Chrome Devtools to modify the rendered HTML and CSS of an existing website.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the website of your choice and open Chrome Devtools. In particular, you want to open the element inspector.

  * You can open launch Devtools with `Cmd + Option + I` on  a Mac and `Ctrl + Shift + I` on a PC. Alternatively, just right-click the web page and select the "inspect" option. Make sure the `Elements` tab is selected.

* From here, modify the web page inside of the element inspector. Examples of possible modifications include:

  * Edit the text inside the HTML tags.

  * Change the HTML tags. e.g. turn all the `<p>` tags into `<h1>` or `<strong>` tags.

  * Alter an element's CSS, e.g. make all of the text green or give the HTML document a background image.

  * Insert brand new HTML into the DOM.

  * Delete a few HTML elements.

* Try and have fun here, get creative!

* Once you're happy with your modification, take a screenshot of the modified page and slack it out in the class channel.
