# Media Queries

* The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate how media queries can be used to apply different CSS rules to elements.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.html` file in your browser and open `styles.css` in your editor.

* Uncomment the first CSS rule inside of the media query and resize your browser window. Once the screen shrinks below 480px, `.box-1` should turn purple.

* Repeat this for each CSS rule inside of the media query and notice how the new rules are applied only when the screen shrinks to 480px or less.

* Any number of media queries can be added in order to apply styles that are specific to specified minimum or maximum screen sizes.
