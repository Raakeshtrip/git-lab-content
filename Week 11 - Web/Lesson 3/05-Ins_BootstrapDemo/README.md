# Bootstrap Demo

* The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate how the Bootstrap grid can be used to create a web layout.

## Instructions

* Open the [`index.html`](Solved/index.html) file in both your browser and in your editor.

* In your web browser, read the explanation for Bootstrap grid, while noting how the code compares to the rendered page.

* Notice how the medium sized columns go full width if you shrink your browser window by dragging the edge. This is Bootstrap's default behavior, which makes our websites somewhat mobile responsive out of the box.
