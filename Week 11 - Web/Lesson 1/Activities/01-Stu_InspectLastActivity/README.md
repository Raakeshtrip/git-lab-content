### Instructions

* Open the example from the last activity slacked out to you in Chrome and open Chrome Devtools. You can launch Chrome Devtools by doing any of the following:

  1. Right click the rendered HTML document inside of Chrome and clicking the `inspect` option.

  2. Pressing `F12` on Windows while in Chrome.

  3. Pressing `command + option + i` on a Mac.

* Make sure the `Elements` tab is selected.

* Study the code here and see how it compares to the actual HTML document slacked out.

* Experiment with modifying the HTML document in VS Code and reloading the web page and inspector. 

  * What happens when you remove an element's closing tag or misspell `head` or `html`?
