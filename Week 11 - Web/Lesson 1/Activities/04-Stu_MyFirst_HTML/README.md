### Instructions

In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include in it the following:

1. `DOCTYPE` declaration

2. `head` tag with nested `title` tag

3. `h1` tag with a title of your choice

4. Embed an image

5. Create the following three links on your page:

   1. One link that leads to the website of your choice. Give this link an attribute `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked.

   2. Create a second link to a different website, but give this link bold text.

   3. Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.

HINT: You should be checking the rendered HTML in Chrome as you code to make sure you're going in the right direction.

### Bonus

* Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.

* Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.

* Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.

* Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.
