### Instructions

* With a partner, research and create a list of different HTML elements and their descriptions.

* This list should be a combination of elements we've gone over already and some new elements we haven't yet discussed.

* Try to list as many elements as possible.

  * Identify which elements are void elements (self-closing), and which are not.

  * Create a valid, informational HTML document where you use and describe and use as many of the different researched elements as possible.
