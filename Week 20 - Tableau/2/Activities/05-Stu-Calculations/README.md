# Calculations

## Instructions

* The data set you have been given is on motor vehicle accidents in New York city.

* Try to create visualizations to the following questions:

  * What are the most dangerous hours for cyclists in a day?
  * What are the most dangerous months for a cyclist?
  * What are the most common causes of accidents?
  * How many people have been injured during each month?

* Are there any possible problems or issues with these visualizations?  

* Use calculations and logical statements to enhance your visualizations. Some of them may include:

  * Using conditional logic to color dangerous months, boroughs, and hours
  * Charting the increase or decrease in the number of injuries in each month relative to the previous month.
  * Feel free to revisit earlier data sets to create calculations.

* Use your imagination, and good luck!
