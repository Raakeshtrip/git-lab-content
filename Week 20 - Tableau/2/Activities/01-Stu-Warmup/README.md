  * Is there a relationship between an institution's average ACT/SAT scores and the average number of doctorates awarded?
  * Which regions in the United States have the greatest percentage of students receiving federal grant aid?
  * Is there a correlation between SAT scores and regions?
  * Of the institutions with religious affiliations, schools belonging to which denominations receive the most foreign undergraduate students?
  * Do foreign undergraduates prefer institutions that award only bachelor's degrees, or master's, or doctorates?
  * Of institutions that offer bachelor's, master's, or doctorates as the highest degrees, which have the highest graduation rates within four years?
  * Is there a correlation between tuition and SAT scores?
