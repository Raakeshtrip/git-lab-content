# Dog Intelligence & Size

* **Woof!** In this activity, you will explore the relationship between a dog's size and its intelligence. Woof!

## Instructions

* Join the two CSV files provided to access info on dog breeds and potential markers of intelligence.

  * The Obey column refers to a dog breed's average rate of obedience to the first command.
  * The Reps Lower column refers to a dog breed's lower ceiling of repetitions required to learn a new command.
  * The Reps Upper column refers to a dog breed's upper ceiling of repetitions required to learn a new command.

* Group all the breeds into **small, medium, and large breeds** by weight, and plot obedience on first command, minimum number of repetitions required to learn a new command, and the maximum number of repetitions required to learn a new command. 

  * Measure dog weight as you see fit, either by lower or upper limit, or an average of both.
  * For the purposes of this activity, small dogs are considered to weigh up to 20 pounds, medium dogs weigh up to 60 pounds, and large dogs weigh over 60 pounds.

* Create sets of small, medium, and large dog breeds and compare the obedience rate of small dogs versus non-small dogs.

  * Compare also small dogs' minimum and maximum repetitions versus non-small dogs
  * Try doing the same for large breeds versus non-large breeds

* Come up with other ways to use groups and sets. Make some interesting visualizations!

* What conclusions can you draw?

## Bonus

* If you finish early, go back to earlier data sets and try to create some visualizations using groups or sets. For example, with the data set on higher education, can you visualize the average SAT and ACT scores at institutions that award only bachelor's degrees, at institutions that award up to master's degrees, and at institutions that award up to doctorate degrees?
