# Unemployment Map

* In this activity, you will further familiarize yourself with building maps with Tableau.

## Instructions

* Use `employment.csv`, a dataset constructed from the Bureau of Labor Statics data, to visualize unemployment in the United States.

* Create a map of unemployment between 2008 and 2016, by county. Which areas in the United States have been the hardest hit during that period?

* Create an unemployment map, by county, during the period 1990-1998. How does it compare and contrast with the map from 2008-16?

* Create a map of counties with the highest rates of unemployment between 2008 and 2016. Use Tableau's built-in census data to discover the relationship, if any, between counties with the highest rates of unemployment and the median per capita income, by county. Which counties had the highest unemployment rate during this period?

* Come up with other visualizations, perhaps looking at the relationship between race and unemployment on a county-by-county basis.
