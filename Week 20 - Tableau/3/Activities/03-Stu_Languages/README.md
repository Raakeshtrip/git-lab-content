# Endangered Languages

## Instructions

* In this activity, you are given a data set of endangered languages throughout the world. 

* Create several visualizations regarding endangered languages, which may include:

  * The number of endangered languages per country

  * The number of critically endangered countries per country

* Additionally, join the data set to an additional data source to create extra visualization(s).

  * For example, you might bring in data about the per capita GDP of each country to visualize the wealthiest nations with the greatest number of endangered languages. That is, which countries have the most endangered languages and have the economic means to assist their preservation?

  * Or you might look at the overall literacy rate of countries. Is low literacy rate an impediment to preservation of endangered languages?
