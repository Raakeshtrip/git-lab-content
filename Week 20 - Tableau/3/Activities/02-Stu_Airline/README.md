# Airlines

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will explore the safety of the world's airlines. The data set used here is from [fivethirtyeight.com](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/airline-safety)

* It will be an open-ended exploration of the data, but some questions to consider might be:

  * What are the safest airlines in the world, and how do we define the idea of safety?

  * Can we group airlines by region to determine whether some regions have better track records than others? What are some possible fallacies of this approach?
