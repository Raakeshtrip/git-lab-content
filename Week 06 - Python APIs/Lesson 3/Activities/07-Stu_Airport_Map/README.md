# Hot Airport Reviews

## Instructions

* If you haven't yet, navigate to your [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and enable the __Maps JavaScript API__.

* Install `gmaps`
  - If it's not already running, start your virtual environment.
    - On Windows: `activate PythonData`
    - On Apple: `source activate PythonData`
  - Then, from the command line run: `conda install -c conda-forge gmaps`

* Using the starter notebook and the airport CSV in the Resources folder, create a heat map of the airports across the country.
  - Use the latitude and longitude to place the airport
  - Use the rating to weight the heat map.
    - Be sure to handle `NaN` values and data type in your Airport Ratings.
  - Refer to the [gmaps documentation](http://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#heatmaps) for instructions on how to implement heatmaps.
