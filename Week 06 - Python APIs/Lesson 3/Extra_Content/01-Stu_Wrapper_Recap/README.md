# API Recap

In this warm-up activity, we will utilize the openweathermapy API wrapper to query the OpenWeatherMap API.

* **Instructions:**

  * Using the starter file and openweathermapy API wrapper, write a script to check the five-day forecast for Phoenix, Arizona.

  * Your final code should the print the results using the below format:

    ```output
    2017-01-17 09:00:00 | 43.92 F
    2017-01-17 12:00:00 | 40.62 F
    2017-01-17 15:00:00 | 39.07 F
    ```

* **Hints:**

  * See the [OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)

* **Bonus:**

  1. Use a method from openweathermapy that will parse through every record returned, extracting the desired data, without the use of a loop.

  2. Create code that will plot the forecasted temperature over time.
