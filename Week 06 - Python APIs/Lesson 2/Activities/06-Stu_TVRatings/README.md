### TV Ratings

Create an application that:
* reads in a list of TV shows
* makes multiple requests from an API to retrieve rating information
* creates a Pandas DataFrame
* visually displays the data.

## Instructions:

* You may use the list of TV shows provided in the starter file or create your own.

* Request information on each TV show from the [TVmaze API's Show Search endpoint](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search)
* Store the name and rating information into lists.

* Store this data in a dictionary and use it to create a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use matplotlib to create a bar chart comparing the ratings of each show.
