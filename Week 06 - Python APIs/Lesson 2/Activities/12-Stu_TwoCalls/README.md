# Lending Types

This activity provides an opportunity to practice making two API calls in sequence in which the second API call depends on the response of the first.

## Instructions

* Retrieve a list of the lending types the world bank keeps track of, and extract the ID key from each of them.

* Next, determine how many countries are categorized under each lending type. Use a dict to store this information. 

  * This data is stored as the first element of the response array.

* Finally, print the number of countries of each lending type.
