# Cities & Weather

This activity provides practice making API calls iteratively.

## Instructions

For this exercise, either work with `cities.csv` as provided, or add a few cities of your own. If you finish the main challenge and feel ambitious, try using a subset of [CountriesToCities.json](https://github.com/David-Haim/CountriesToCitiesJSON) for this activity.

* Load your `cities.csv` file, and use it to create a list of city names you can search for.

* Request weather information on each city, and store each response in a list.

* Collect longitude and atmospheric pressure data for each city. Use the API documentation to determine which keys to extract.

* Put this data into a dict, and load that dict into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use matplotlib to create a scatter plot of pressures vs longitudes.
