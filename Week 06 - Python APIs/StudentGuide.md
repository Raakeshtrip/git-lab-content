## Unit 6 - Python APIs

### Overview

This week we will cover the using third party APIs with Python. Students will programmatically obtain and parse data from sources such as OpenWeatherMap, the US Census, OMDB, and more. We will plot Data Frames from the API data using Matplotlib.

### Objectives

* Be able to make GET requests with `requests`.
* Be able to convert JSON into a Python dictionary.
* Read and apply API documentation.
* Sign up for and use an API key.
* Create applications from scratch using nothing but knowledge of Python and an API documentation.
* Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Be able to use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors.
* Successfully use the Google Maps and Places API to obtain information about geographic areas.
* Understand how to use the Census API wrapper.
* Understand the concept of rate limits and the importance of creating "test cases" prior to running large scripts.
* Have a firmer understanding of how to dissect new API documentation.
