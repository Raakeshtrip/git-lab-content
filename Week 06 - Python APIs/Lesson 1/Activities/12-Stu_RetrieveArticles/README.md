# Instructions

* Save the NYT API endpoint to a variable. Make sure you include the right query parameter to retrieve JSON data!

* Register for and save your API Key to a variable.

* Decide on a search term, and save it to a variable.

* Limit your search to articles published within a range of dates—for example, only articles published in 2014. _Hint_: Read the documentation on `end_date`.

* Build your query URL, and save it to a variable.

* Retrieve your list of articles with a GET request.

* Take a look at the documentation. How do you get ahold of the articles in the response?

* Store each article in the response inside of a list.

* Print a `snippet` from each article.

* As a bonus, try to figure out how we could get 30 results. _Hint_: Look up the `page` query parameter. If you get a message saying you've exceeded your rate limit, don't fret—you've solved the problem.
