# Far Far Away

* **Instructions:**

  * Using the starter file provided, collect the following pieces of information from the Star Wars API.

    - The name of the character

    - The number of films they were in

    - The name of their first starship

  * Once the data has been collected, print it out to the console.

* **Hints:**

  * It would be in your best interest to print out the JSON from the initial request before anything else. This will let you know what keys you should reference.

  * The "starship" values are links to another API call. This means that you will need to create a request based off of the values of a previous request.

* **Bonus:**

  * Collect and print out all of the films a character appeared in.
