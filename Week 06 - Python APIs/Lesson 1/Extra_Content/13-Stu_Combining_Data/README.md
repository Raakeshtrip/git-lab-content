* Initialize your info dictionary, and the name of the movie you'll search for.

* Initialize variables containing the URLs of the NYT and OMBd APIs, as well as your NYT API KEY.

* Make a request to the OMDb and NYT APIs for the movie you've selected.

* Save some information from the OMDb response to your info dictionary, such as its director or plot summary.

* Save a list of URLs to some of the articles from the NYT response, and save them to your info dictionary.
