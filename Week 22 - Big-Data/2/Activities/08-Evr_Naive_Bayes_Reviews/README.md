## Classifying Yelp Reviews

### Instructions

1. Read in the file containing Yelp reviews.

2. Create a column that adds the length of the review as a feature.

3. Create a list of transformations to be applied in the pipeline:

   * Change positive and negative to an index.

   * Tokenize the review.

   * Filter out stop words.

   * Calculate term frequency using `HashingTF`.

   * Calculate TFâ€“IDF.

4. Create a feature vector containing the output from the IDFModel (the last stage in the pipeline) and the length.

   * Set up the pipeline and and fit it to the data.

   * Create training and testing data.

   * Create and fit the Naive Bayes model to the training data.

   * Predict outcomes using the testing set.

   * Use `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator` to evaluate the model on the testing set.
