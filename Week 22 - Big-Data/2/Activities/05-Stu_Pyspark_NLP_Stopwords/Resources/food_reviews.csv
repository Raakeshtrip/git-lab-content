The pasta was a dish I had
We ate the fish it was tasty
My family did not like the food here
The girl even tried to spread each half out to cover the roll.
this is his job and since it was probably the slowest time of the day I would at least expect him to take my order and put the sandwich through. And of course no apology. So I had to wait for the woman to finish with the couple who came in after me before she finally got to my sandwich.
I'm always greeted by the  employees and they always seem eager to help.
