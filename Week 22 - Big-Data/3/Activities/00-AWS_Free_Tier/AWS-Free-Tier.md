# Amazon Web Services Free Tier

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has three types of free offers available depending on the product that you choose: free tier, 12 months free, and trials. The details of each free offer can be found here: [https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/).

All activities in the Big Data unit will use free tier services. However, it is still possible to [incur charges](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/free-tier-charges/) while using the free tier service. Therefore, before you sign up and use any AWS Free Tier service, make sure you review all the services and resources covered under [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). AWS provides additional information on how to avoid free tier charges [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/free-tier-charges/).
