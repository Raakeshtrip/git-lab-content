# United States Population Growth Part 1

Time to put all your skills to use and create a summary of the US population growth.

## Instructions

* Fill in all of the states in Column A on the Summary sheet.

* Match each state with its population from 2000 in column B

* Match each state with its project population for 2030 in column C

* In Column D, get the percent change from 2000 to 2030.

* If the population is expected to increase, color with a shade of blue

* If the population is expected to decrease color, with a shade of yellow.

* All Code should be written as a single VBA script which can be run on any sheet with the same result.

## Hints

* Before writing any code, plan out how you will accomplish each step. Write a summary of what you think needs to get done, and then write down the steps in plain english. This is called pseudo-coding.
