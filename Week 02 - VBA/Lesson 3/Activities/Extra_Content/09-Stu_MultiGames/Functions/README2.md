# United States Population Growth Part 2

Now that we have some clean looking results, let's see what change there are.

## Instructions

* Find the total population of the USA for **2000** and **2030**, respectively.

* Find the great population and State for **2000** and **2030**, respectively.

* Find the lowest population and state for **2000** and **2030**, respectively.

* Complete this activity using worksheet functions and a single VBA script.

* Use variables where you can.

## Hint

* Remember for worksheet functions, the values start one higher because they don't include headers when counting.

* Eyeball the results to make sure they are correct. Keep in mind that this becomes tougher to do when data sets become much larger (i.e. thousands of records).
