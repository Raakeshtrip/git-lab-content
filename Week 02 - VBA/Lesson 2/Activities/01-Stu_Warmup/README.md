# Budget Checker

## Instructions

* Create a VBA Script to complete the budget checker.

* There are three parts to this problem.

  * Part 1: Calculate the total after fees and enter the value in the "Total" cell.

  * Part 2: Create a Message Box for the user to designate whether the amount including fees is within or over budget.

  * Part 3 (Challenge): If the total is over budget, correct the price such that it fits within the max of the user's budget. Be sure to round down! (Example: If the user's budget is 100 and the fees are 15%, the max price should 86)

## Hints

* Break up the problem into smaller steps.

* Look at old code!

* You got this!
