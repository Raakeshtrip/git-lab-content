# The VBA Lotto

## Instructions

* You are in charge of finding our winners for a local lotto drawing.

  * The results are, in order:

    * First: 3957481
    * Second: 5865187
    * Third: 2817729

  * Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet.

    * For each winner include the following pieces of information:

      * First name
      * Last name
      * The winning number

    * They should be placed in winning order of First, Second, Third.

    * There should also be a message box that congratulates the first place winner.

## Bonus
