# Instructions

In this activity, you will use the pre-trained `Xception` CNN model to predict image labels.

* Visit the [Xception](https://keras.io/applications/#xception) documentation to determine the image_size and other parameters needed to load and use the model.

* Pre-process the test image using the model's `preprocess_input` function.

* Use the trained model to predict the output label for the puppy image.

## Bonus

* Refactor the above steps into a reusable function that accepts an input image and returns a pre-processed image.

* Test the code by preprocessing the image of a kitten and printing the predicted labels.
