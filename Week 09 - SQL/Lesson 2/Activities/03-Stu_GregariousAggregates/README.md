## Gregarious Aggregates

In this activity, you will practice writing queries with aggregate functions, with grouping, and with using aliases.

### Instructions

Use aggregate functions as you run queries to answer the following questions. You will have to search the internet for some of them. Try to use aliases for more informative column headings.

1. What is the average cost to rent a film ?

2. What is the average rental cost of films by rating? On average, what is the cheapest rating of films to rent? What is the most expensive?

3. How much would it cost to replace all films in the database?

4. How much would it cost to replace all films in each ratings category?

5. How long is the longest movie in the database? How long is the shortest movie?

**Hint**: Consult the Postgres documentation on [aggregate functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html) for a summary of the available functions.
