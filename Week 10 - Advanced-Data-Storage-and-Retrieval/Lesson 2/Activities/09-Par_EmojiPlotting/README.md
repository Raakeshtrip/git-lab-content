* **Instructions**:

  * Use the inspector to explore the database and print out the table names stored within it.

  * Using the inspector, print out the column names and types for each of the tables contained within the SQLite file.

  * Reflect the database into a SQLAlchemy class and start a session that can be used to query the database.

  * Using Matplotlib, create a horizontal bar chart and plot the emoji score in descending order. Use `emoji_char` as the y-axis labels and plot only the top 10 emojis ranked by score

  * Create the same kind of chart using Pandas to plot the data instead of Matplotlib.
