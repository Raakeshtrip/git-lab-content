* **Instructions**:

  * Create engine using the `demographics.sqlite` database file

  * Declare a Base using `automap_base()` and use this new Base class to reflect the database's tables

  * Assign the demographics table/class to a variable called `Demographics`

  * Create a session and use this session to query the `Demographics` table and display the first five locations

* **Bonus**:

  * Query and print the number of unique locations in the table.

* **Hint**:

  * For the bonus, look into counting and grouping operations in SQLAlchemy
