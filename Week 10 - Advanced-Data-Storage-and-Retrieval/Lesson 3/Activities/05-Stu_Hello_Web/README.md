# Hello, Web

This activity allows students to practice setting up a server and defining basic routes with Flask.

## Instructions

* Create an `app.py`, and make the necessary imports.

* Use Flask to create an `app` instance.

* Use route decorators to define the following endpoints:

  * `/`, or your **index route**: This should return a simple string, such as `"Hello, world!"`, or `"Welcome to my API!"`

  * `/about`, which should return a string containing your **name** and **current location**.

  * `/contact`, which should return a string telling visitors where to email you.

* Finally, add code at the bottom of the file that allows you to run the server from the command line with: `python app.py`.

## Hints

* Refer to the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) as you work through this activity.
