## Instructions

* Create a `Surfer` class that has `name`, `hometown`, `rank`, and `wipeouts` instance variables.

* Create a method called `speak` that prints "Hangs loose, bruh!"

* Create a method called `biography` that prints the surfer's name and hometown.

* Create a method called `cheer` that will print "I totally rock man, no wipeouts!" if the surfer has no wipeouts. Otherwise, it prints 'Bummer bruh, keep on keeping on!'.

* Create two surfers that print out all their info and run all the methods.


## Bonus

* Add a method to your class that prints out how many surfers are currently shredding.

### HINT

* Create a class variable shared by all instances of `Surfer` and an instance variable to increment it each time a new surfer is created.

* Refer to the [Python documentation on classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
