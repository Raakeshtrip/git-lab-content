# Student Deep Learning Challenge

In this activity, you will create a regular Neural Network and a Deep Neural Network. Then, compare the accuracy of each.

## Instructions

* Create a Neural Network and Deep Neural Network Classifier that correctly classifies both moons from the dataset.

* Train both models using 100 training epochs.

* Compare the accuracy of both models.

### Bonus

* Try to find the minimal architecture (number of nodes) and minimum training iterations required to achieve a score of at least .90.
