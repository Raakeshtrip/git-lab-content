# KNN

* In this activity, you will determine the best `k` value in KNN to predict diabetes for the Pima Diabetes DataSet.

## Instructions

* Calculate the Train and Test scores for `k` ranging from 1 to 20. Use only odd numbers for the k values.

* Plot the `k` values for both the train and test data to determine where the best combination of scores occur. This point will be the optimal `k` value for your model.

* Re-train your model using the `k` value that you found to have the best scores. Print the score for this value.
