# Trees

* In this activity, you will compare the performance of a decision tree to a random forest classifier using the Pima Diabetes DataSet.

## Instructions

* Use the Pima Diabetes DataSet and train a decision tree classifier to predict the diabetes label (positive or negative). Print the score for the trained model using the test data.

* Repeat the exercise using a Random Forest Classifier with SciKit-Learn. You will need to investigate the SciKit-Learn documentation to determine how to build and train this model.

* Experiment with different numbers of estimators in your random forest model. Try different values between 100 and 1000 and compare the scores.
