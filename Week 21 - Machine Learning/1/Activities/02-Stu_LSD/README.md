# LSD

* In this activity, you will calculate a regression line using a dataset of lsd drug concentrations vs. math scores.

## Instructions

* Start by creating a scatter plot of the data to visually see if any linear trend exists.

* Next, use sklearn's linear regression model and fit the model to the data.

  * Print the weight coefficients and the y-axis intercept for the trained model.

* Calculate the `y_min` and `y_max` values using `model.predict`

* Plot the model fit line using `[x_min[0], x_max[0]], [y_min[0], y_max[0]]`
