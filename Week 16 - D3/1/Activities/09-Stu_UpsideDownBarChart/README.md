# The Upside Down Bar Chart (With Data-Binding!)

## Instructions

* Add code to `app.js` in order to complete a bar chart using data binding.

* Position and style each bar based on the data it represents.

## Bonus

* So far we have been making vertical bar charts exclusively... But we could also apply what we have learned thus far to making horizontal bar charts! Using your newfound knowledge of data-binding and graphing using D3, see if you can create a horizontal bar chart!

* Since the next step in creating bar charts is to flip them right-side-up, experiment with your code a little bit and see if you can figure out how to manage this.

## Hints

* Look at the previous activities for reference!

* See this [article on data-joins with D3](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/), written by D3 creator, Mike Bostock.
