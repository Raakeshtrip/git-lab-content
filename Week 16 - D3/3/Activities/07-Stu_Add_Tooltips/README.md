# Adding Tooltips

In this activity, you will add tooltips to a chart visualizing the number of medals awarded to Norway each day of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

## Instructions

* Run a server and open the HTML file in the browser in order to study the chart.

* Move onto the Javascript file. Take a moment to look through the code and explain it to a partner.

* Write additional logic to render a tooltip for each data-point containing the date as well as the number of medals won. A `dateFormatter` function has already been created. Use it to format the `datetime` object when adding it to the tooltip.
