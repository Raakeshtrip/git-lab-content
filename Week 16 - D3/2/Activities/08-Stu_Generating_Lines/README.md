# Generating Lines

In this activity, we will utilize the data retrieved from a csv to generate a line charting life expectancy over time.

## Instructions

* First, take a few minutes to review the code.

* Note that we cast `year` as a number here. This is for demonstration purposes and will normally be cast as a date object.  You will see this in the next activity.

* Create scales for x and y so that your line fits the SVG properly.

* Create and store a line generator function using the scale functions for x and y.

* Append a path element to the SVG using the line generator and add styling attributes.

* Test your code by running a server and viewing in the browser. Refine as needed.
