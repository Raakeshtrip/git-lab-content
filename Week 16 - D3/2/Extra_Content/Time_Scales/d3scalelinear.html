// A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
// Imagine you have a screen that is 1000 pixels tall
// You want to display your test scores, which range from zero to one hundred, visually

// Question 1: how many pixels tall would a score of 100 be on the screen?
// Answer: 1000px

// Question 2: how many pixels tall would a score of 0 be on the screen?
// Answer: 0px

// Question 3: how many pixels tall would a score of 50 be on the screen?
// Answer: 500px

// Question 4: 75?
// Answer: 750px

// ACTUAL CODE OF THE ABOVE
// domain() defines the extent of the test scores, or from zero to 100
// range() defines, here, the extent of the screen real estate, from 0 to 1000 pixels tall
// d3.scaleLinear() translates a specific test score into height (in pixels)

var myScale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0,100]).range([0,1000]);

console.log(myScale(100));

console.log(myScale(0));

console.log(myScale(50));

console.log(myScale(75));
